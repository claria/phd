\chapter{Theoretical Foundations}
\label{sec:theoretical_foundations}

A deeper understanding about physical principles always relies on the interplay
of theoretical predictions and accompanying experimental measurements.
Theoretical models try to describe the behavior of nature and have to be
confirmed or excluded in precise experiments. In the second half of the 20th
century, theoretical and experimental physicists made great progress in describing the
fundamental particles and their interactions in a self-consistent model which is
now-a-days established as the Standard Model of particle physics.

This chapter shortly summarizes the Standard Model while concentrating on
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its important properties which are the
theoretical foundations of this thesis. More extensive and profound
discussions can be found in~\cite{Peskin:1995ev,Agashe:2014kda,Ellis:1991qj,Buckley:2011ms}.

Throughout this thesis, the common unit conventions in particle physics are
used.  They are based on SI units, but also include the units electron volt
(\si{\electronvolt}) and barn (\si{\barn}). Furthermore, the speed of light $c$
and the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$ are set to unity,
%
\begin{equation*}
    c = \hbar = 1.
\end{equation*}

\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}

The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is a comprehensive theoretical
concept which describes the fundamental particles and their interactions from
basic principles. The SM is founded on the concept of quantum field theories, in
which the interaction between particles are mediated by quantized gauge fields.
While predictions of the SM demonstrated to be extremely robust in a huge variety
of experiments, it falls short in being a complete theory of everything, as it
does not include the gravitational force and cannot describe dark matter as well
as non-zero neutrino masses coming along with neutrino oscillations.

Each of the fundamental spin-\sfrac{1}{2} particles, also known as fermions,
has a corresponding antiparticle with same properties but opposite sign of
quantum numbers. They are classified in three families and carry quantum numbers
of electric charge $Q$, weak isospin $T$ and color. The weak hypercharge $Y_W$
is related to the weak isospin and the electric charge by $Y_W = 2(Q-T_3)$. The
quantum numbers define the coupling of the fermions. There are four fundamental
forces of which three are considered in the SM.

The electromagnetic and weak force are described by a U(1)$\times$SU(2)
symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the coupling to the scalar Higgs
field. The gauge bosons of the unified electroweak theory are a mixture
resulting in the massive $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons and the massless photon. The
eigenstates of the weak interaction differ from the mass eigenstates and can be
calculated by rotating the mass-eigenstates using the CKM
matrix~\cite{Cabibbo:1963yz,Kobayashi:1973fv}. The same effect is observed in
the lepton sector in which the mass eigenstates of the neutrinos do not match
the interaction eigenstates leading to oscillations between neutrino flavors.
The analogue matrix is called PMNS matrix~\cite{Maki:1962mu,Pontecorvo:1957qd}.

The strong force is described by the unbroken $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ color gauge
theory~\cite{Zweig:1981pd,Fritzsch:1973pi}, called quantum chromodynamics. There
are eight gauge bosons, the gluons, which carry color charge. 

The Higgs boson, the field quanta of the Higgs field which causes the
electroweak symmetry breaking and was predicted for a long time by theorists was
recently discovered at the LHC~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj,Aad:2012tfa}.

\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the gauge field theory that describes the
strong interaction of quarks and gluons. The gauge group of the theory is a
special unitary group SU(3). The QCD Lagrangian is given by

\begin{equation*}
   \mathcal{L} = \sum_q \bar \psi_{q,a} \left( i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu
   \delta_{ab} - g_s \gamma^\mu t_{ab}^C \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^C - m_q \delta_{ab}
   \right) \psi_{q,b} - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^{A} F^{A \mu\nu},
\end{equation*}
%
where $\gamma_\mu$ are the Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, $\psi_{q,a}$ are
quark-field spinors for a quark with flavor $q$ and mass $m_q$ and a color of
index $a$ which runs from $1$ to $N_C=3$. $\mathcal{A}_\mu^C$ denotes the gluon
fields and $C$ runs from 1 to $N_C-1$ resulting in eight kinds of gluons. The
QCD coupling strength is defined by $g_s$. The field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}^A$ is
given by

\begin{equation*}
    F_{\mu\nu}^A = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu^A - \partial_{\nu}
    \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^A - g_s f_{ABC} \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^B
    \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^C
\end{equation*}
%
where $f_{ABC}$ are the structure constants of the SU(3) group. The last term of
the field tensor originates from the non-Abelian structure, where the generators
do not commutate, but obey the relation

\begin{equation*}
    \left[t^A, t^B \right] = if_{ABC} t^{C},
\end{equation*}
%
causing the self-coupling of gluons, one of the prominent features of QCD
resulting in three-gluon vertex and four-gluon vertex. The fundamental
interaction vertices of QCD can be illustrated by the Feynman graphs in
Fig.~\ref{fig:fundamental_couplings}. The complete QCD Lagrangian also includes
a gauge-fixing term and the Faddeev-Popov ghost term~\cite{Faddeev:1967fc},
which are neglected here.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption[Fundamental vertices of QCD]{The fundamental Feynman rules of QCD
    comprise a quark-antiquark-gluon vertex, a three-gluon vertex and a four-gluon
    vertex. The first two are proportional to $g_{s}$, the last one
    proportional to $g_{s}^2$.} 
    \label{fig:fundamental_couplings} 
\end{figure}

Unlike the other forces, the strong force force exhibits two unique and opposing
features. It is shown in experiments that quarks and gluons behave like free
particles at high energies or small distances, called \emph{asymptotic freedom}
described in QCD by the falling of the strong coupling at high energies.
However, quarks and gluons cannot be observed as free particles at larger
distances. The strong force rises with increasing distance and the creation of
new quark-antiquark pairs are favored at some point. This phenomenon, called
\emph{confinement}, implies that the strong coupling increases at small energies
and is divergent. Consequently, perturbative QCD is not applicable in this
energy regime.

\subsection{Perturbative QCD}

All observables $X$ in perturbative QCD (pQCD) are developed as a
perturbative series in powers of the strong coupling \as

\begin{equation*}
    X = \sum_{n=0}^N \as^n c_i = c_0 + \as^1 c_1 + \as^2 c_2 + \ldots, 
\end{equation*}
%
where $c_i$ are the perturbative coefficients. The expansion already yields
sufficiently accurate results after the first orders of the perturbative series
if $\as \ll 1$ so that the series converges quickly. However several features
complicate perturbative calculations. Ultra-violet (UV) divergences enter the
calculations beyond leading order in form of loop corrections. The divergences
can be removed by a procedure called renormalization, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:renormalization}. Soft and collinear divergences also need to be
handled in perturbative calculations. They arise from singularities at
phase-space boundaries and neglected quark masses. Observables need to be
defined infrared safe and short-distance effects need to be separated from the
divergent long-range part, which can be factorized into the PDFs, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:factorization}, in a procedure called \emph{collinear
factorization}.

\subsection{Renormalization and Running of the Strong Coupling}
\label{sec:renormalization}

Beyond leading order, the calculations include loop corrections which result in
UV divergences when calculating the momenta integrals of the loops. To make the
result finite, a regularization procedure called renormalization is applied. The
renormalization introduces another scale $\mur$, the renormalization scale.
There are different renormalization schemes, of which the
$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme~\cite{Weinberg:1951ss,tHooft:1973mm} is the most
popular. Consequently the observable $X$ and the strong coupling become
functions of this scale \mur. 

Nonetheless, the observable $X$ may not depend on the arbitrarily chosen \mur.
The renormalization group equation (RGE) states that the dependence of $X$ on
\mur must cancel. This can be mathematically expressed by

\begin{equation} 
    \mur^2 \frac{d}{d \mur^2} X \left(\frac{Q^2}{\mur^2},\as(\mur^2)\right) = \left(
    \mur^2 \frac{\partial X}{\partial \mur^2} + \mur^2 \frac{\partial
    \as(\mu^2)}{\partial \mur^2} \frac{\partial X}{\partial \as(\mu^2)} \right) \stackrel{!}{=} 0 
\end{equation}
%
and states that any dependence of $X$ on \mur must be cancelled by the
\mur-depedence of \as. Subsequently the strong coupling has to fulfill the
equation

\begin{equation}
    \mur^2 \frac{d \as}{d \mur^2} = \beta(\as) = - \left( \beta_0 \as^2 + \beta_1 \as^3
    + \beta_2 \as^4 + \ldots \right)
    \label{eq:as_rge}
\end{equation}
%
where $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta 2$ are the 1-loop, 2-loop and 3-loop 
$\beta$-function coefficients, which are given for the coupling of an effective
theory, in which the $n_f$ quark flavors are light ($m_q \ll \mur$). Here, they
are given in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme:

\begin{equation} 
    \beta_0 = \frac{33 - 2 n_f}{12\pi},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
    \beta_1 = \frac{153 - 19 n_f}{24\pi^2},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
   \beta_2 = \frac{2857 -\left(\sfrac{5033}{9}\right)n_f + \left(\sfrac{335}{27}
   \right)n_f^2}{128 \pi^3}.
\end{equation}
%
By integrating Eq.~\ref{eq:as_rge}, the energy dependence of \as is given. In an
energy range of constant number of flavors, an analytic solution exists in
1-loop approximation. 

\begin{equation*}
   \as(\mur^2) = \frac{1}{\beta_0 \ln \left( \sfrac{\mur^2}{\Lambda^2} \right)}
\end{equation*}

$\Lambda$ is the constant of the integration and corresponds to the scale at
which the perturbative coupling would diverge. Very often it is convenient to
give the strong coupling at a specific scale, from which the coupling at any
scale is calculated. It is common practice to report \asmz, the strong couplint
at the scale of the Z-boson. Consequently the 1-loop analytical function can be
expressed as

\begin{equation*}
   \as\left(\mur, \as(\mz)\right) = \frac{\as(\mz)}{1 + \as(\mz)\beta_0 \ln
       \left( \sfrac{\mur^2}{\mz^2} \right)}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{figure}[htb] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/sm_model/as_running.pdf}\hfill
    \caption[Running of the strong coupling]{Running of the strong coupling
        constant as predicted by QCD. Determinations of the strong coupling from
        several experiments are shown at the scale of the measurement and prove
        the running up to \SI{1}{\TeV}. Recent measurements from
        CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2014waa,CMS:2014mna} probe the running at even
        higher scales. Figure taken from~\cite{Agashe:2014kda}.} 
    \label{fig:as_running} 
\end{figure}


As the parameter \as is a free parameter of the theory, it is determined from
experimental measurements and evolved to the scale of the $Z$-boson. The current
world average value of the strong coupling according to the
PDG~\cite{Agashe:2014kda} reads as

\begin{equation*}
    \asmz = 0.1185 \pm 0.0006
\end{equation*}
%
and is determined from hadronic $\tau$-lepton decays, lattice QCD calculations,
deep-inelastic scattering data, electron-positron annihilation processes and
electroweak precision fits. Fig.~\ref{fig:as_running} shows various
determinations of the strong coupling constant from measurements at scales $Q$,
which describe the running of the strong coupling up to the \SI{1}{\TeV} scale.

\subsection{Factorization and Parton Density Functions}
\label{sec:factorization}

The perturbative series is only converging sufficiently fast for $\as(\mur) \ll
1$. As this is not given for low energies, perturbative calculations are not
applicable in this energy regime. Emissions which modify the momentum of a
parton are to a large extent collinear to the parton. The \emph{factorization
theorem} describes the separation of these long-distance interactions from the
short-distance interactions, the hard process. The factorization again involves
an arbitrary choice of factorization scale \muf. Emissions with transverse
momenta above \muf are included in the hard scattering perturbative
coefficients while emission softer than \muf are accounted for within the PDFs.

\paragraph{DGLAP Evolution Equations}

Consequently, the PDF depend on the scale \muf. The resulting \muf dependence is
described by the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi
(DGLAP)~\cite{Gribov:1972ri,Altarelli:1977zs,Dokshitzer:1977sg} equations, which
have a different structure between the gluon and quark PDFs. They are defined at
leading order as for the quark PDFs $q_i(x, \muf)$,

\begin{equation*}
    \muf \frac{\partial q_i (x, \muf)}{\partial \muf} = \left[ q_i \otimes P_{qq}
    \right] + \left[ g \otimes P_{qg} \right],
\end{equation*}
%
and for the gluon PDF $g(x, \muf)$ as
%
\begin{equation*}
    \muf \frac{\partial g (x, \muf)}{\partial \muf} = \left[\sum_i  q_i \otimes P_{gq}
    \right] + \left[g \otimes P_{gg}\right]
\end{equation*}
%
using the shorthand notation

\begin{equation*}
    \left[f \otimes P \right] = \left[ P \otimes f \right] = \int_x^1 \frac{d
    \xi}{\xi} f\left(\xi, \muf\right) P\left( \frac{x}{\xi} \right)
\end{equation*}
%
where the sum runs over all quark and antiquark flavors. $P_{ab}$ are
the Altarelli-Parisi kernels, known as splitting functions. They give give the
probability to emit a parton $a$ with momentum fraction $x$ from a parton $b$
with momentum fraction $\xi$.

\paragraph{Parton Distribution Functions}

The structure of the proton is described by parton distribution functions
(PDFs). They represent the probability density\footnote{More precise a number
density as the PDFs are normalized to the number of partons.} to find a parton
carrying a momentum fraction $x$ of the proton momentum at a squared energy
scale $Q^2$. 

The DGLAP equations describe the evolution of the PDFs from a starting scale
$Q_0$ to an arbitray scale $Q$. However, the $x$-dependence of the PDFs as well
as the PDFs themselves at the starting scale $Q_0$ cannot be calculated, but
have to be derived from fits to data from experiments.

Several groups determine the proton PDFs in global fits to a large variety of
measurements from different experiments. Instead of determining all 13 quark,
antiquark and gluon PDFs independently, the number can be reduced by choosing a
sufficiently low starting scale $Q_0$ below the threshold of the charm quark
mass and calculating the heavy flavor PDFs in a heavy flavor
scheme~\cite{Thorne:2006qt}. Furthermore, the PDFs of the top and anti-top quark
are often neglected due to its large rest-mass. In a fit, each parton is
parameterized with a sufficiently flexible function to describe the
$x$-dependence at the starting scale $Q_0$. The PDFs are evolved to the 
scales of each measurement and the PDF parameters are adapted in an iterative
$\chisq$ fit.

Global PDFs are determined by the
CTEQ~\cite{Dulat:2015mca}, MMHT~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa},
NNPDF~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} and the ABM~\cite{Alekhin:2013nda} groups at LO, NLO
and NNLO. While the range of measurements, which are put into the fit are often similar,
there are differences in the applied minimization method, phenomenological
approaches and the estimation of the uncertainties. More details are given in
Sec.~\ref{sec:pdf_uncertainties} in which the uncertainty of the PDFs on the
cross section measurement is discussed.

    from~\cite{Dulat:2015mca}.}
    \label{fig:ct14_parton_distributions} 
\end{figure}

The HERAPDF group~\cite{Abramowicz:2015mha} uses a slightly different approach
by using a less flexible parameterization but restricting the data to
measurements from the HERA experiments, which provide a very precise and
compatible data set. Furthermore the HERAPDF group released their fitting
framework HERAFitter~\cite{Alekhin:2014irh} as open source software, which can
be used by anyone.  HERAFitter is employed in Sec.~\ref{sec:pdf_constraints} to
study the constraints of the triple differential dijet measurement, which is
presented in this thesis, on the PDFs.

        The most important input for the PDFs still results from DIS data
        measured at HERA. Further important constraints at high-$x$ and low
        scales are given by fixed-target experiments. The latest PDF sets also
        include LHC measurements with provide constraints at high scales $Q^2$
        and high-$x$ (jets, $t\bar t$) and at medium-$x$ ($W$,$Z$,+jets). Figure

\section{Hadronization and Parton Shower}

As perturbative QCD calculations lack the capabilities of describing the
soft component of the interaction, additional models are employed which describe
the emission of additional partons and the hadronization into color-less bound
states. 

\subsection{Parton showers}

The accelerated colored partons undergo subsequent emission of gluons. Unlike in
QED radiation, gluons themselves carry color charge and therefore also emit
further gluons, leading to the parton shower. 

The dominant contributions come from collinear parton splitting and soft gluon
emissions. The collinear splitting of a parton is described by splitting
functions which are identical to the DGLAP splitting functions. The
successive application of the splitting to the colored particles leads to the
parton shower. The evolution of the shower is determined by an evolution
variable. Common choices involve the virtual-mass squared of the partons in the
shower, the transverse momentum or the angle. The parton shower is terminated
when the scale is below the hadronization scale which is of order $\SI{1}{\GeV}$.

Actually the parton shower mimics the effect of higher-order corrections. As
they are often not feasible to be calculated, the parton shower approximation is
used instead. Though, great care has to be taken to avoid any double counting if
using a NLO generator in combination with a parton shower.

\subsection{Hadronization}

The result of the parton shower is a large number of color charged particles. As
color charged objects cannot be observed as free particles, they have to
hadronize into bound states which are color-less. The MC event generators Pythia
and Herwig employ different models to simulate the hadronization process. Pythia
uses the Lund string fragmentation model while Herwig is based on the cluster
fragmentation model.

\paragraph{Lund String Fragmentation Model}

Within the Lund string model, the attraction between a $q\bar q$ pair is
modeled through strings, whose energy follows a coulomb potential as a function
of the distance between the two quarks. Final-state gluons from the parton
shower are considered as kinks in the strings. If the string exceeds a certain
threshold, it breaks up and new quark-antiquark pairs are formed. If the
available energy is too small, the quarks and antiquarks recombine into mesons
and baryons.

\paragraph{Cluster Fragmentation Model}

At first, all gluons are split into quark antiquark pairs. Neighboring pairs are
grouped together to form color-less clusters. Most of the clusters decay into
hadrons in an isotropic two-body phase space model.

\section{Jet Algorithms}
\label{sec:jet_algorithms}

The information of the clustered stream of particles, also known as jets,
provides the link between the short-scale physics and the final-state
observations. There are many different algorithms available which cluster jets
from a set of input objects. Both \CMS and \ATLAS rely on the \antikt and
inclusive-\kt jet algorithms, which proved to be very robust and both are
collinear and infrared safe, see Section~\ref{sec:coll_safety}. They are
sequential recombination algorithms and combine input objects based on a
distance measure in Minkowski space. All jets were reconstructed using the
efficient algorithms implemented in the \textsc{FastJet} library~\cite{Cacciari:2011ma}.

\subsection{Collinear and Infrared Safety}
\label{sec:coll_safety}

Hard partons undergo many collinear splittings in the fragmentation process.
Furthermore, there are always emissions of soft particles in QCD-like events
caused by non-perturbative and perturbative effects. The reconstructed jets
should be insensitive to all these effects. Furthermore, fixed-order pQCD
calculations are associated with divergent tree-level matrix elements and the
corresponding loop level matrix elements. While these divergences cancel for
infrared safe and collinear safe jet algorithms, this is not guaranteed for jet
algorithms not fulfilling the infrared and collinear safety
requirements.\todo{Klaus fragen}
Fig.~\ref{fig:infrared_safety} shows the effect of a collinear splitting (right
plot) and of additional soft particles (left plot) on the results of an unsafe
jet algorithm. Most of the cone-based jet algorithms which cluster elements
by employing a constant distance measure in the $\eta-\phi$ space are affected by the
previously mentioned issues. This leads to the popularity of the modern sequential
recombination algorithms which are used in almost all of today's jet-based
analyses.

    algorithms]{The influence of an infrared emission and a quasi
        collinear splitting on a jet algorithm not fulfilling the infrared safe
        and collinear safe requirements is shown. An additional soft particle (left plot)
    leads to the combination of the two jets into one large jet. A
quasi-collinear splitting of a particle (right plot) changes the result of the
jet clustering algorithm.}
    \label{fig:infrared_safety}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generalized \kt Jet Algorithms}

The most popular sequential recombination algorithms are the \kt jet
algorithms which cluster jets based on a jet size parameter $R$ and an
additional parameter $p$, introducing a dependence on the transverse momentum of
the input objects. The pair-wise algorithm uses a list of input objects which
can be partons, stable particles or reconstructed particle candidates.

At first, the distance $d_{ij}$ between two particles and the distances of the
particles to the beam $d_{iB}$ and $d_{jB}$ are calculated based on the rapidity
difference $\Delta y_{ij}$ and the azimuthal angle $\Delta \phi_{ij}$ between two
particles $i$ and $j$

\begin{align*} 
    d_{ij} &= \min(p_{\mathrm{T}i}^{2p},p_{\mathrm{T}j}^{2p})\frac{\left(\Delta
        R_{ij}\right)^2}{R^2}\\
    d_{i\mathrm{B}} &= k_{\mathrm{T}i}^{2p}
\end{align*} 
%
with the angular distance
%
\begin{align*}
    \left(\Delta R_{ij}\right)^2 &= (\Delta y_{ij})^2 + (\Delta \phi_{ij})^2
\end{align*} 
%
If distance $d_{ij}$ is smaller than the distances to the beam line, the two
particles $i$ and $j$ are merged into a new particle $k$ which then replaces the
particles $i$ and $j$ in the input list. These steps are repeated until all
particles are clustered into jets. Since the distance measures are defined in
Minkowski space, the shapes of the jets in the $\eta-\phi$ plane are not circular but
irregular, see Figure~\ref{fig:jet_shapes}. Based on the parameter $p$, there
are three important \kt based algorithms with distinct properties:

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/jet_reconstruction/jet_shapes.pdf}
    \caption[Jet areas of various jet algorithms]{Catchment areas of jets obtained by the described \kt-based algorithm
        and the cone-based SISCone algorithm~\cite{Salam:2009jx}. For most jet
        algorithms the shape is irregular, while the \antikt algorithm yields
        circular shapes for hard jets while soft jets are crescent shaped. Taken
        from~\cite{Berger:2014aca}.}
    \label{fig:jet_shapes}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $p=1$: The \textbf{Inclusive $\mathbf{\kt}$
    algorithm}~\cite{Catani:1991hj,Catani:1992rm} is based on a \ptsq
        distance measure and approximately describes the inversion
        of the QCD branching process.\todo{ref}
    \item $p=0$: The \textbf{Cambridge-Aachen
        algorithm}~\cite{Dokshitzer:1997in} is only based on the spatial
        separation of the objects and does not rely on the transverse energy of
        the input objects. Similarly to the inclusive \kt algorithm its jets
        have an irregular shape. This jet algorithm is particularly interesting
        for jet substructure studies.
    \item  $p=-1$: The \textbf{anti-$\mathbf{\kt}$
    algorithm}~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} favours clustering hard input objects
    resulting in fairly circular jet shapes for hard jets, while soft jets are
    crescent-shaped if they are close to a hard jet.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dijet Production at Hadron-Hadron Colliders}

When two hadrons collide, the actual interaction takes place between the
constituents of the proton, the partons. The cross section $\sigma$ of such a hard
scattering process can be computed in collinear factorization through

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \sigma_{H_1 H_2 \rightarrow X} = &\sum_{i,j} \int dx_1 dx_2 f_{i, H_1}
    \left(x_1, \muf^2 \right) f_{j,H_2} \left(x_2, \muf^2 \right) \\ 
    &\times \hat\sigma_{i,j \rightarrow X} \left( x_1 P_1, x_2P_2, \as(\mur^2),
    \frac{Q^2}{\muf^2} \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
where $f_i$ and $f_j$ denote the parton distributions which depend on the
momentum fraction $x$ of the parent hadron $H$ and the factorization scale
$\muf$. The parton-level cross section $\hat \sigma$ for the production of the
final state $X$ depends on the final-state phase, the factorization scale and
the renormalization scale. The sum runs over all contributing initial-state
partons. Fig.~\ref{fig:crosssection_factorization} illustrates the factorization
into the PDFs and the hard scattering cross section.

\subsection{Kinematics of the Dijet System}
\label{sec:dijet_kinematics}

The outgoing partons of a hard interaction manifest themselves as a spray of
collimated particles, which are clustered into jets. Consequently, the
properties of jets are studied in order to gain a deeper understanding about
QCD and the proton structure. In the following discussion, the incoming partons
involved in the scattering process are assumed to be massless and collinear to
the beam protons. Furthermore, it is convenient to describe the kinematic of
the dijet system using the transverse momentum \pt and the rapidity $y$, as it
is introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:coord_system}. The rapidity $y$, defined as

\begin{equation*}
    y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{E+p_z}{E-p_z} \right),
\end{equation*}
%
is at lowest order directly related to the proton momentum fractions $x_1$ and
$x_2$ via
%
\begin{equation*}
    x_1 = \frac{x_\mathrm{T}}{2} \left( e^{y_1} + e^{y_2} \right)
    \qquad\text{and}\qquad x_2 = \frac{x_\mathrm{T}}{2} \left( e^{-y_1} +
    e^{-y_2} \right),
\end{equation*}
%
with $x_{\mathrm{T}} = \pt/E$ and the rapidities $y_1$ and $y_2$ of the
two outgoing partons.

        {Dijet event in the laboratory frame (left) with the rapidities $y_1$
        and $y_2$ of the jets and in the center-of-mass frame (right) with the
    rapidities $\pm\ystar$.}
    \label{fig:dijet_cm_lab_frame}
\end{figure}

The longitudinal boost of the parton-parton center-of-mass (CM) frame with
respect to the proton-proton CM frame, \yboost, is calculated from the
rapidities $y_1$ and $y_2$ of the two jets emerging from the partons. 

\begin{equation*}
    \yboost = \frac{1}{2} |y_1 + y_2|
\end{equation*}

The quantities $\pm\ystar$ are the jet rapidities of the two jets in the
parton-parton CM frame. Since they are symmetric, \ystar is defined as half the
absolute rapidity separation between the two jets.

\begin{equation*}
    \ystar = \frac{1}{2} |y_1 - y_2|
\end{equation*}

\ystar is related to the polar scattering angle $\theta^*$ with respect to the
beamline by 

\begin{equation*}
    \ystar = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1 + |\cos \theta^*|}{1- | \cos \theta^*|} \right).
\end{equation*}
