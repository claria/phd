\chapter{Theory Predictions for the Triple-Differential Dijet Cross Section}

\section{Discussion of the Diejt Observable}

For a long time, leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading (NLO) predictions
for dijet production processes were the ultimate precision possible. While
describing the shape and the normalization of many cross section distributions
accurately, they are also subject to larger scale uncertainties. 

The goal of this thesis is a publication of a high-precision dijet cross section
measurement to gain a better understanding of the theory of quantum chromodynamics
at high scales accesible at the LHC. Unlike earlier dijet analyses, the observable
choice was optimized to yield the best-possible constraints on the proton PDFs as well
as the strong coupling.

For nearly ten years, theorists have been working on the calculation of next-to
next-to-leading order (NNLO) predictions for dijet cross sections. This  and this
huge project
