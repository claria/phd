\chapter{Theoretical Foundations}
\label{sec:theoretical_foundations}

A deeper understanding about physical principles relies always on the interplay
of the theoretical predictions and accompanying experimental meausurements.
Theoretical models try to describe the behaviour of nature and have to be
confirmed or excluded in precise measurements.

This chapter shortly summarizes the Standard Model of particle physics and
concentrates on quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and its important properties which
are the theoretical foundation of this thesis. Extensive and much more profound
discussions can be found in~\cite{all_theory_used}.

\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}

The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is a comprehensive theoretical
concept which describes the fundamental particles and their interactions from
basic principles. The SM is founded on the concept of quantum field theories, in
which the interaction between particles are mediated by quantized gauge fields.

Each of the fundamental spin-$\sfrac{1}{2}$ particles, also known as fermions,
has a corresponding antiparticle with same properties but opposite sign of
quantum bumbers. They are classified in three families and carry quantum numbers
of electric charge $Q$, weak isospin $T$ and color. The weak hypercharge $Y_W$
is related to the weak isospin and the electric charge by $Y_W = 2(Q-T_3)$. The
quantum numbers define the coupling of the fermions. There are four fundamental
forces of which three are considered in the SM.

The electromagnetic and weak force are described by a $U(1)\times SU(2)$
symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the coupling to the scalar Higgs
field. The gauge bosons of the unified electroweak theory are a mixture
resulting in massize $W^\pm$ and the $Z^0$ boson and the massless photon. The
eigenstates of the weak interaction differ from the mass eigenstates and can be
calculated by rotating the mass-eigenstates using the CKM
matrix~\cite{Cabibbo:1963yz,Kobayashi:1973fv}. The same effect is observed in
the lepton sector in which the mass eigenstates of the neutrinos do not match
the interaction eigenstates leading to oscillations between neutrino flavors.
The analogue matrix is called PMNS matrix~\cite{Maki:1962mu,Pontecorvo:1957qd}.

The strong force is described by the unbroken $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ color gauge
theory, called quantum chromodynamics. There are eight gauge bosons, the gluons,
which carry color charge. 

The Higgs boson, the field quanta of the Higgs field which causes the
electroweak symmetry breaking and  was predicted for a long time by theorists.
Recently, it was discovered in at the LHC~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj,Aad:2012tfa}.

\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the gauge field theory that describes the
strong interaction of quarks and gluons. The gauge group of the theory is a
special unitary group SU(3). The QCD Lagrangian is given by

\begin{equation*}
   \mathcal{L} = \sum_q \bar \psi_{q,a} \left( i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu
   \delta_{ab} - g_s \gamma^\mu t_{ab}^C \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^C - m_q \delta_{ab}
   \right) \psi_{q,b} - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^{A} F^{A \mu\nu},
\end{equation*}

in which $\gamma_\mu$ are the Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, $\psi_{q,a}$ are
quark-field spinors for a quark with flavor $q$ and mass $m_q$ and a color of
index $a$ which runs from $1$ to $N_C=3$. $\mathcal{A}_\mu^C$ denotes the gluon
fields and $C$ runs from 1 to $N_C-1$ resulting in eight kinds of gluons. The
QCD coupling strength is defined by $g_s$. The first part describes

The field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}^A$ is given by, 

\begin{equation*}
    F_{\mu\nu}^A = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu^A - \partial_{\nu}
    \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^A - g_s f_{ABC} \mathcal{A}_{\mu}^B
    \mathcal{A}_{\nu}^C
\end{equation*}

where $f_{ABC}$ are the structure constants of the SU(3) group. The last term of
the field tensor originates from the non-Abelian structure,  where the generators
do not commutate, but obey the relation

\begin{equation*}
    \left[t^A, t^B \right] = if_{ABC} t^{C},
\end{equation*}

causing the self-coupling of gluons, one of the prominent features of QCD. The
fundamental interaction vertices of QCD can be illustrated by the Feynman graphs
in Fig.~\ref{fig:fundamental_couplings}.

\subsection{Perturbative QCD}

All observables $X$ in perturbative QCD (pQCD) are developed as a
perturbative series in powers of the strong coupling \as. 

\begin{equation*}
    X = \sum_{n=0}^N \as^n c_i 
\end{equation*}

where $c_i$ are the perturbative coefficients. The expansion already yields
sufficiently accurate results after the first orders of the perturbative series,
if $\as \ll 1$ and the series converges quickly. However several features
complicate the perturbative calculations. Ultra-violet (UV) divergences enter
the calculations beyond leading order in form of loop corrections. The
divergences can be removed by a procedure called renormalization, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:renormalization}.

Soft and collinear divergences also need to be handled in perturbative
calculations. They arise from singularities at phase-space boundaries and the
neglected quark masses. Observables need to be defined infrared safe and
short-distance effects need to be separated from the divergent long-range part,
which can be factorized into the PDFs, see Sec.~\ref{sec:factorization}.

\subsection{Renormalization and Running of the Strong Coupling}
\label{sec:renormalization}

Beyond LO, the calculations include loop corrections, which result in UV
divergences when calculating the momenta integrals of the loops. To make the
result finite, a regularization procedure called renormalization is applied. The
renormalization introduces another scale $\mur$, the renormalization scale.
There are different renormalization schemes, of which the
$\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme is the most popular. Consequently the observable
$X$ and the \as become functions of this scale \mur. 

Nonetheless, the observable $X$ may not depend on the arbitrarily chosen \mur.
The renormalization group equation (RGE) states that the dependence of $X$ on
\mur must cancel. This can be mathematically expressed by

\begin{equation} 
    \mur^2 \frac{d}{d \mur^2} X \left(\frac{Q^2}{\mur^2},\as(\mur^2)\right) = \left(
    \mur^2 \frac{\partial X}{\partial \mur^2} + \mur^2 \frac{\partial
    \as(\mu^2)}{\partial \mur^2} \frac{\partial X}{\partial \as(\mu^2)} \right) \stackrel{!}{=} 0 
\end{equation}

and states that any dependence of $X$ on \mur must be cancelled by the
\mur-depedence of \as. Subsequently the strong coupling has to fulfill the
equation

\begin{equation}
    \mur^2 \frac{d \as}{d \mur^2} = \beta(\as) = - \left( \beta_0 \as^2 + \beta_1 \as^3
    + \beta_2 \as^4 + \ldots \right)
    \label{eq:as_rge}
\end{equation}

where $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta 2$ are the 1-loop, 2-loop and 3-loop 
$\beta$-function coefficients, which are given for the coupling of an effective
theory, in which the $n_f$ quark flavors are light ($m_q \ll \mur$). Here, they
are given in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme.

\begin{equation} 
    \beta_0 = \frac{33 - 2 n_f}{12\pi}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
    \beta_1 = \frac{153 - 19 n_f}{24\pi^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
   \beta_2 = \frac{2857 -\left(\sfrac{5033}{9}\right)n_f + \left(\sfrac{335}{27}
   \right)n_f^2}{128 \pi^3}
\end{equation}

By integrating Eq.~\ref{as:rge} the energy dependence of \as is given. In an
enery range of constant number of flavors, an exact analytic solution exists in
1-loop approximation. 

\begin{equation*}
   \as(\mur^2) = \frac{1}{\beta_0 \ln \left( \sfrac{\mur^2}{\Lambda^2} \right)}
\end{equation*}

$\Lambda$ is the constant of the integration and corresponds to the scale at
which the perturbative coupling would diverege. Very often it is convenient to
give the strong coupling at a specific scale, from which the coupling at any
scale is calculated. It is common practice to report \asmz, consequently the
1-loop analytical function becomes

\begin{equation*}
   \as\left(\mur, \as(\mz)\right) = \frac{\as(\mz)}{1 + \as(\mz)\beta_0 \ln
       \left( \sfrac{\mur^2}{\mz^2} \right)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{figure}[htb] 
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/sm_model/as_running.pdf}\hfill
    \caption[Running of the strong coupling]{} 
    \label{fig:fundamental_couplings} 
\end{figure}


As the parameter is a free parameter of the theory, it is determined from
experimental measurements and evolved to the sclae of the $Z$-boson. The current
world average value of the strong coupling according to the PDG reads

\begin{equation*}
    \asmz = 0.1185 \pm 0.0006.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Factorization and Parton Density Functions}
\label{sec:factorization}

The perturbative series is only converging sufficiently fast for $\as(\mur) \ll
1$. As this is not given for low energies, perturbative calculations are not
applicable in this energy regime. 


The \emph{factorization theorem} separates the short-distance interactions,
which are calculated in the hard matrix element, from long-distance interactions
at an additionally introduced factorization scale \muf. This non-perturbative
long-distance part of the interaction is included in the parton distributions of
the proton. Consequently they PDFs cannot be calculated in pQCD, but have to be
determined experimentally.

\paragraph{DGLAP Evolution Equations}

Emissions which modify the momentum of a parton are to a large extent collinear
to the parton. The \emph{factorization theorem} describes the separation of
these long-distance interations from the short-distance interactions, the hard
process. The factorization again involes an arbitrary choice of factorization
scale \muf. Emission with transverse momenta above \muf are included in the hard
scattering perturbative coefficiencts while emission softer than \muf are
accounted for within the PDFs.

Consequently, the PDF depend on the scale \muf. The resulting dependence can be
described by the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equations,
which are in LO defined as

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial f_a (x, \muf^2)}{\partial \muf^2} = \sum_b \frac{\as(\muf^2)}{2 \pi} \int_x^1
    \frac{d \xi}{\xi} P_{ab} \left(\frac{x}{\xi},
    \as(\muf^2)\right) f_b(\xi, \muf)
\end{equation*}

where $f_a$ is the parton distribution function of flavor $a$ and $P_{ab}$ are
the Altarelli-Parisi kernels, known as splitting functions. 

\begin{equation*}
    \muf \frac{\partial}{\partial \muf} f_a(x, \muf^2)  = \sum_{j=q,\bar q, g}
    P_{aj} \otimes f_j(x, \muf^2
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    \left[ P \otimes f \right] = \int_{x}^1 \frac{d \xi}{\xi} f\left(\xi,
    \muf \right) P\left(\frac{x}{\xi}\right)
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{Parton Distribution Functions}

The structure of the proton is described by parton distribution functions
(PDFs).  They represent the probability density\footnote{more precise a number
density as the pDFs are normalized to the number of partons} to find a parton
carrying a momentum fraction $x$ of the proton momentum at a squared energy
scale $Q^2$. 

The DGLAP equations describe the evolution of the PDFs from a starting scale
$Q_0$ to an arbitray scale $Q$. However, the $x$-dependence of the PDFs as well
as the PDFs themselves at the starting scale $Q_0$ cannot be calculated, but
have to be derived from fits to data from experiments.

Several groups determine the proton PDFs in global fits to a large variety of
measurements from different experiments. Instead of determining all the 13
quark, antiquark and gluon PDFs independently, the number can be reduced by
choosing a sufficiently low starting scale $Q_0$ below the threshold of the
charm quark mass and calculating the heavy flavour PDFs in a heavy flavour
scheme~\cite{rt_scheme}. Furthermore the PDF of the top and anti-top quark is
often neglected due to its large rest-mass. In the fits, each parton is
parametrized with sufficiently flexible function to the describe the $x$
dependence at the starting scale $Q_0$. The PDFs are evolved to the higher
scales of each measurement and the PDF parameters are adapted in an iterative
$\chisq$ fit.

    \caption[Kinematic phase space of the experiments]{} 
    \label{fig:fundamental_couplings} 
\end{figure}

Global PDFs are determined by the
CTEQ~\cite{Dulat:2015mca},MMHT~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa},
NNPDF~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} and the ABM~\cite{Alekhin:2013nda} groups at LO, NLO
and NNLO. While the measurements which are put into the fit are often similar,
there are differences in the applied minimization method, phenomenological
approaches and the estimation of the uncertainties. More details are given in
Sec.~\ref{sec:pdf_uncertainties} in which the uncertainy of the PDFs on the
cross section measurement is discussed.

The HERAPDF group~\cite{Abramowicz:2015mha} uses a slightly different approach
by using a less flexible parameterization but restricting the data to
measurements from the HERA experiments, which provide a very precise and
compatible dataset. Furthermore the HERAPDF group released their fitting
framework HERAFitter~\cite{Alekhin:2014irh} as open source software, which can
be used by anyone.  HERAFitter is employed in Sec.~\ref{sec:pdf_constraints} to
study the constraints of the triple differential dijet measurements on the PDFs.

\section{Hadronization and Parton Shower}

As perturbative QCD calculations lack the capabilities of describing the
soft component of the interaction, additional models are employed which describe
the emission of additional partons and the hadronization into color-less bound
states. 

\subsection{Parton showers}

The accelerated colored partons undergo subsequent emission of gluons. Unlike in
QED radiation, gluons themselves carry color charge and therefore also emit
further gluons, leading to the parton shower. 

The dominant contributions come from collinear parton splitting and soft gluon
emissions. The collinear splitting of a parton is described by splitting
functions which are identical to the DGLAP splitting functions. The
subsequential application of the splitting to the colored particles leads to the
parton shower. The evolution of the shower is determined by an evolution
variable, \eg the virtual-mass squared of the partons in the shower. The upper
limit on the initial virtuality is given by the momentum transfer scale of the
hard process while the shower is terminated when the virtualities fall below the
hadronization scale, which is of the order of $\SI{1}{\GeV}$.

Actually the parton shower mimics the effect of effect of higher-order
corrections. As they are often not feasible to be calculated, the parton shower
approximation is instead used. Though great take has to be taken to avoid any
double counting if using a NLO generator in combination with a parton shower.


\subsection{Hadronization}

The result of the parton shower is a large number of color charged particles. As
color charged particles cannot be observed, they have to hadronize into bound
states which are color-less. The MC event generators Pythia and Herwig employ
different models to simulate the hadronization process. Pythia uses the Lund
string fragmentation model while Herwig is based on the cluster fragmentation
model.

\paragraph{Lund String Fragmentation Model}

Within the Lund string model, the attraction between a $q\bar q$ pair is
modeled through string, whose energy follows a coulomb potential as a function
of the distance between the two quarks. Final-state gluons from the parton
shower are considered as kinks in the strings. If the string exceeds a certain
threshold, it breaks up and new quark-antiquark pairs are formed. If the
available energy is too small, the quarks and antiquarks recombine into mesons
and baryons.

\paragraph{Cluster Fragmentation Model}

At first, all gluons are split into quark antiquark pairs. Neighbouring pais are
grouped together to form color-less clusters. Most of the clusters decay into
hadrons in an isotropic two-body phase space model.
