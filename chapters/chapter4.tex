\chapter{Jet Reconstruction}

In scattering processes with large momentum transfers, the outgoing partons
produce a collimated stream of particles in the parton shower and the
hadronization. The cluster of these particles are the experimental signatures
for quarks and gluons in the detector and are called \emph{jets}. Jets show up
in the CMS detector as a localized deposit of energy in the calorimeters
accompanied by a large number of tracks in the direction of the deposited
energy. Jets can be reconstructed using different techniques based on the amount
of information available. If the jets are reconstructed from the energy clusters
within the calorimeters, they are called \emph{calorimeter jets}. If the jet
reconstruction uses particle flow object, these are called \emph{particle flow
jets}.

\section{The Particle Flow Algorithm}

CMS uses the particle flow reconstruction
algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001,CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001} to identify particles in
an event by combining the information of all detector subsystems. These are the
tracks and vertices, reconstructed from hits in the tracking detectors, the
deposited energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and the tracks
in the muon system. The reconstructed particles are then classified as muons,
electrons, photons, charged hadrons or neutral hadrons. The combination of all
subdetectors yields an optimal determination of their momentum, energy and type.

The tracks are found using the Combinatorial Track Finder (CTF)
algorithm~\cite{Adam:2005cg} employed by CMS. Based on these tracks, the primary
vertices in an event can be identified. The electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimeters are divided into a grid of cells based on the detector granularity
to identify calorimeter cluster seeds.  If there are seed with an energy
exceeding a threshold, they are used in an iterative merging algorithm to form
particle flow clusters. The different elements of the detector information are
then linked together into particle flow building blocks based on the geometry
and \chisq fits. At first, the muons, which can be well identified using the
tracks in the muon detector, are reonstructed using the building blocks
connected to the muon system. Building blocks connecting the inner tracking
system with the ECAL clusters can be used to identify electrons. Similarly
charged hadrons are then identified using the links between the tracking system
and the remaining calorimeter clusters. Only neutral objects which have no
traces in the tracking system are left. ECAL clusters are interpreted as photon
candidates, while the remaining HCAL clusters are assumed to be deposits of
neutral hadrons. To avoid any kind of double-counting of energy, all particle
flow building blocks of succesfully reconstrcuted particle candiates are removed
and the energy of the calorimeter cluster is recalculated.

Finally a set of so called particle flow candidates is yielded consisting of
well identified particles, which profit from the improved resolution obtained by
the inclusion of the tracking information. This collection of particles is then
used to reconstruct the jets.

\section{Jet Algorithms}

The information of the clustered stream of particles, known as jets, provide the
link between the short-scale physics and the our final-state observations. There
are many different algorithms available which cluster jets from a set of input
objects. Many of them were found to have their very specific problems and today,
both \CMS and \ATLAS rely on the \antikt and inclusive \kt jet algorithms which proved to be very
robust and both are collinear and infrared safe, see~\ref{section:coll_safety}.
They are sequential recombination and combine the input objects based on a
distance measure in Minkowski space. 

\subsection{Collinear and Infrared Safety}
\label{section:coll_safety}

Hard partons undergo many collinear splittings in the fragmentation process.
Additionally there are always emissions of soft particles in QCD-like events,
caused by non-perturbative and perturbative effects. The reconstructed jets
should be insensitive to all these effects. Additionally, fixed-order pQCD
calculations are associated with diverged tree-level matrix elements and the
corresponding loop matrix level elements. While these divergences cancel for
infared and collinear safe jets, this is not guaranteed for jet algorithms not
fullfilling the infrared and collinear safety. Figure~\ref{fig:infrared_safety}
shows the effect of a collinear splitting and of additinal soft particles on
unsafe jet algorithm. Most of the cone based jet algorithms which cluster
elements based on a constant distance in the $\eta-\phi$ space, are affected by
the mentioned issues leading to the popularity of the sequential recombination
algorithms which are used in almost all modern jet-based analyses.

        and the cone-based SISCone algorithm~\cite{Salam:2009jx}.}
    \label{fig:jet_shapes}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generalized \kt Jet Algorithm}

The most popular sequential recombination algorithms are the the \kt jet
algorithms which cluster jets based on a jet size parameter $R$ and an
additional parameter $p$ introducing a dependence on the transverse momentum of
the input objects. The pair-wise algorithm uses a list of input objects like stable
particles or particle flow candidates. 

\begin{align} 
    d_{ij} &= \min(p_{\mathrm{T}i}^{2p},p_{\mathrm{T}j}^{2p})\frac{\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2}\\
    d_{i\mathrm{B}} &= k_{\mathrm{T}i}^{2p}
\end{align} 

with the angular distance

\begin{align}
    \Delta R_{ij}^2 &= (\Delta y_{ij})^2 + (\Delta \phi_{ij})^2\\
\end{align} 

At first the distances $d_{ij}$ between the two particles and $d_{iB}$ are
calculated based on the rapidity difference $\Delta y_{ij}$ and the azimuthal angle
$\Delta \phi_{ij}$ betwen two particles $i$ and $j$. If distance $d_{ij}$ is
smaller than the distances two the beam line, the two particles $i$ and $j$ are
merged into a new particle $k$ which replaces the particles $i$ and $j$ in the
input list. These steps are repeated until all particles are clustered into
jets. Since the distance measures are defined in Minkowski space, the shapes in
the $\eta-\phi$ plane are not circular but are irregular, see
Figure~\ref{fig:jet_shapes}. Based on the parameter $p$, there are three
important \kt based algorithms with distinct properties

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/jet_reconstruction/jet_shapes.pdf}
    \caption{The obtained jet areas for the the discussed \kt based algorithm
        and the cone-based SISCone algorithm~\cite{Salam:2009jx}.}
    \label{fig:jet_shapes}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Inclusive \kt algorithm (p=1)} is based on a \ptsq
        distance measure which attempts to approximately describe the inversion
        of the QCD branching process.
    \item The \textbf{Cambridge-Aachen algorithm (p=0)} is only based on the
        spatial separation of the objects and does not rely on the energy of
        the input objects. Similarly to the inclusive \kt algorithm its jets
        have an irregular shape. This jet algorithm is in particular interesting
        for jet substructure studies.
    \item The \textbf{Anti-\kt algorithm (p=-1)} favours clustering hard input
        objects resulting in fairly circular jet shapes for hard jets, while
        soft jets are crescent-shaped if they are close to a hard jet~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Jet Area}

The jet area describes the space in the $\eta-\phi$ plane covered by a jet
object. While cone-based jet algorithms yield a $\pi R^2$ size area, the area
for sequential based jet areas needs to be determined for each jet. A large
number of infinitely soft particles, so-called ghost particles, are evenly
distributed in the event and the area of a jet $A_j$ is assumed to be propoprtinal to the
number of ghost particles clustered into the jet. The jet area is
especially important in the context of pile-up mitigation, which makes use of
the median pile-up and underlying event \pt density $\rho$ in the event 

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \text{median} \frac{\pt^j}{A_j}
\end{equation}

describing the median energy deposition of per unit area.

\section{Jet Energy Corrections}

A detailed understanding of th jet energy scale and the jet transverse momentum
resolution is important to draw conclusions about the properties of quarks and
gluon produced in hih-energy prcesses. On experimental side, there are multiple
effects causing the reconstructed jet energy to not correspond to the true jet
energy, like electronic noise, pile-up and underlying event effects, but also
non-linearities in the calorimeter response and numerous further small effects.
The jet reconstruction and definition itself also introduce effects due to the
fragmentation model, initial state- and final state radiation \etc. 

The jet energy corrections (JEC) relate the measured jet energy to the
corresponding true particle jet. CMS uses a factorices correction approach
consisting of, at least, three corrections steps based on each other. The total
correction factor to be applied on an uncorrected jet is

\begin{equation}
    \pt^{\mathrm{corr}} = c_{\mathrm{res.}} (\eta, \pt') \cdot c_{\mathrm{MC}}
    (\eta \pt'') \cdot c_{\mathrm{pileup}}(\eta, \rho, A_j, \pt^{\mathrm{raw}}) \cdot \pt^{\mathrm{raw}} 
\end{equation}

where \pt' is the transverse momentum of the jet after applying the pile-up
correction and \pt'' is the \pt of the jet after applying the pile-up and the
realtive corrections.

\subsection{Pile-up Corrections}

The first step is to remove the effects of pile-up. Additional soft proton-proton
interactions produce particles being clustered into the jets origination from
the hard interaction. This additional amount of energy needs to be subtracted by
the pile-up correction. The applied correction is based on the jet area method
by using the pile-up density $\rho$ in the event and the jet area $A$. The raw
jet energy is then corrected by a factor proportional to the pile-up density and
the jet area.

\subsection{MC Corrections}

Based on a QCD data sample the jet energy scale is further corrected. The
momentum of a reconstructed jet can differ from a generated particle jet due to
additional out-of-cone effects or detector ineffiencies, which were modelled
using the detector simulation. The inverse response of the reconstructed jet to
a generated jet is applied as correction.

\subsection{Residual Data Corrections}

Additional effects which can not be reliably estimated in a Monte Carlo
simulation are corrected for using data-driven methods. This correction step is
only applied on data. The relative residual corrections are based on a
well-balanced dijet events, in which a forward probe jet is calibrated using a
tag jet in the well understood barrel region. The last correction step is the
absolute residual correction in which well balanced Z+jet events are used to
calibrate the jet energy using the very precisely reconstructed Z.
