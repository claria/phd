\chapter{Theory Predictions for the Triple-Differential Dijet Cross Section}
\label{sec:theory_predictions}

Point-like parton-parton scattering processes in high-energy collisions can
produce jets with large transverse momenta. Events containing two such jets in
the final state, also known as dijet events, allow for rigorous tests of
perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics predictions and can subsequently be used to
further constrain the proton PDFs and to extract Standard Model parameters like the
strong coupling constant~\as.

Next-to-leading-order (NLO) pQCD predictions have been available for dijet and
multi-jet observables since many years. These accurately describe shape and
normalization of jet cross sections, although they still suffer from larger
scale uncertainties limiting the precision of Standard Model parameters
extracted from measurements.

For almost ten years, theorists have been working on improving the jet cross
section predictions by providing next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO)
corrections for dijet calculations. When these corrections become publicly
available, they will push the precision of pQCD jet cross section predictions to
a new level.

With the finalization of this huge project steadily approaching, we provide a
measurement which is specifically designed to benefit from these enhancements.
The ultimate aim of this measurement is the improvement of the proton PDFs,
especially the gluon PDF, by analyzing dijet events with large transverse
momenta.\todo{when done add simultaneous PDF+as fit}

Common cross section measurements like the inclusive jet cross section are well
understood but have the disadvantage that PDF sensitive and insensitive phase
space regions are not well separated which limit the constraining power of these
measurements.

Therefore, triple-differential cross section observables were studied in this
thesis, which promise to yield the most information about the proton structure.
As already introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:dijet_kinematics} the rapidities of the
dijets are directly related to fractional proton momenta. So it appears natural,
to measure the energy of the dijets as a function of the rapidities of the
leading and second jet. However, by explicitly binning the measurement in the
leading and second jet as it is suggested in~\cite{Giele:1994xd}, a dependence
on the \pt-ordering of the jets is introduced. While the ordering according to the
transverse momentum of the jets is irrelevant at LO, since both jets are
perfectly balanced and have the same transverse momentum, it becomes relevant at
NLO. The order of the jets can be changed by a soft emission causing a different
ordering of the jets in \pt. Simply put, the second jet can become the leading
jet and vice versa. Thus it is not guaranteed that all divergences are canceled.
As a consequence the observable becomes infrared unsafe. This can be overcome by
filling all events twice into the histograms with interchanged leading and
second jet. However this produces correlations between phase space regions far
off in rapidity and unnecessarily complicates the measurement, especially the
unfolding procedure.

Therefore a different definition of the cross section is chosen in this
analysis. Instead of using the rapidities and the transverse momenta of each
jet, variables which are symmetric between permutations of the leading two
jets are used. As these variables are linear combinations of the jet rapidities,
no information is lost. Sec.~\ref{sec:crosssection_definition} presents the
cross section definition chosen for the analysis. The subsequent sections  present
NLO pQCD predictions for the cross section as well as detailed studies of all
sources of uncertainties afflicting the cross section calculations.

\section{Cross Section Definition}
\label{sec:crosssection_definition}

The triple-differential dijet cross section is motivated by its relation of
kinematic properties of the dijet system to the fractional proton momenta which
were introduced in~\ref{sec:dijet_kinematics}. It is measured as a function
of average transverse momentum \ptavg and is binned in half the absolute
rapidity separation \ystar, representing the rapidities of the dijets in the CM
frame, and the boost of the dijet system \yboost. The triple-differential cross
section, which reads as

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{d \sigma}{d \ptavg d\ystar d \yboost}
\end{equation*}
%
is based on the variables
%
\begin{align*}
\ptavg &=\frac{1}{2}(\ptone + \pttwo)\\
\yboost& =\frac{1}{2}|y_1 + y_2|\\
\ystar &=\frac{1}{2}|y_1 - y_2|
\end{align*}
%
where \ptone and \pttwo denote the transverse momentum, and $y_1$ and $y_2$ the
rapidities of the leading and second leading jet. Kinematic cuts of the two
leading jets ensure the comparability of the measurement and the calculations:

\begin{align*}
    \ptjet &> \SI{50}{\GeV}\\
    |y_\mathrm{jet}| &\leq 3.0\\
    \ptavg &> \SI{133}{\GeV}
\end{align*}

The phase space cuts on the transverse momentum and rapidity of the jets are
motivated by detector acceptance, trigger efficiencies and also ensure a phase
space with small non-perturbative corrections. The cut on \ptavg results from
the jet triggers employed in the measurement which reach full efficiency only
above \SI{133}{\GeV}.

\begin{figure}[h!tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/drawings/ybys.pdf}
    \caption[Dijet topologies in \ystar and \yboost phase space]
        {An illustration of the dijet topologies in the various \ystar and
        \yboost bins. Dijet events are separated in same-side and opposite-side
        events which allows to draw conclusions about the properties of the
    initial state partons.}
    \label{fig:ysyb_schema}
\end{figure}

The binning of the cross section in \ystar and \yboost has the additional
advantage that same-side (SS) and opposite-side (OS) dijet events are separated into
different bins. Fig.~\ref{fig:ysyb_schema} depicts the dijet topologies in the
various \ystar and \yboost bins. If the rapidity separation and the boost of the
dijet event are small, both jets must have a low rapidity and consequently also
small \ystar and \yboost values. These events are filled in the bottom left bin.
If the dijet system is boosted but the two jets have a small separation in
rapidity, both jets must be boosted in the forward region to the same side, see
bottom right . If instead the dijet separation is large and the boost of the
dijet system is small, the jets are boosted to opposite sides. Dijet events with
both a large rapidity separation and a large boost of the dijet system are
suppressed in the accessible phase space.

The differentiation in SS and OS dijet events is especially interesting since
both event topologies must access different fractional proton momenta while the
jets manifest themselves in the same (forward) detector region. Therefore,
differences in the predictions can be attributed to the PDFs. This is clearly
visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdf_uncertainties}, which shows the PDF uncertainties of
the cross section calculations. The measurement bin containing the events with
the largest rapidity separation, see bottom right plot, has a significantly larger
PDF uncertainty since the high fractional proton momenta are accessed and the
PDFs are less precisely known in this region.

\section{Fixed Order NLO Calculations}

The NLO cross section of the triple-differential dijet cross section is
calculated using fastNLO~\cite{Kluge:2006xs,Britzger:2012bs} which uses
interpolation tables filled with the perturbative coefficients of the \NLOJETPP
program~\cite{Nagy:2003tz}, see Sec.~\ref{sec:nlojetpp}. The PDFs are accessed
via the LHAPDF library~\cite{Whalley:2005nh,Buckley:2014ana} and the
\as-evolution is performed using the routines provided by the PDF sets.
Employing \fastNLO instead of a direct calculation with \NLOJETPP gives the
possibility to repeatedly calculate the cross sections with  different PDFs and
scale choices as it is necessary for the calculation of PDF and scale
uncertainties.

\subsection{Scale Choice}
\label{sec:scale_coice}

Within perturbative cross section calculations, one has to choose a
factorization scale \muf and a renormalization scale \mur. The influence of
these scales vanishes if the calculation is performed for all orders of the
perturbative series. However, since the perturbative series is truncated at
NLO, a scale dependence on the result remains. Three possibilities for the scale
choice are studied in this thesis.  The most natural scale choice is the average
transverse momentum  of the dijet system which is also used as observable and
therefore reflects the energy scale of the measurement.

\begin{equation*}
    \mu = \mur = \muf = \frac{p_{\mathrm{T},1} + p_{\mathrm{T},2}}{2}
\end{equation*}

While this scale choice yields reasonable results, the $k$-factors and scale
uncertainties indicate problems, which are discussed in detail in
Sec.~\ref{sec:k_factors} and Sec.~\ref{sec:scale_uncertainties}. The second
investigated scale choice is based on the findings of a recent analysis by the
ATLAS collaboration~\cite{Aad:2011fc}. They claim that fixed-order calculations
which are binned in the rapidity separation \ystar become  unreliable for high
values of \ystar if the scale choice only depends on the energy. Based on
recommendations of theorists~\cite{Ellis:1992en}, a scale which also depends on
the rapidity separation is proposed.
\todo{more motivation}

\begin{equation*}
    \mu = \mur = \muf = p_{\mathrm{T,max}} e^{0.3 \ystar} 
\end{equation*}

Furthermore a variation of this scale choice is studied in which the scale is not
dependent on the transverse momentum of the leading jet but on the average
transverse momentum of the leading two jets as this again resembles the
observable in the measurement.

\begin{equation*}
    \mu = \mur = \muf = p_{\mathrm{T,avg}} e^{0.3 \ystar} 
\end{equation*}

Fig.~\ref{fig:xs_nlo_comp} shows the predictions of the NLO calculation using
the three discussed scale choices. The cross sections predicted by each
calculation are similar with somewhat larger deviations for the scale choice using the
maximum transverse momentum instead of the average dijet transverse momentum.
The differences between the predictions however are covered by scale
uncertainties.

        different scale choices are shown revealing differences up to 10\%. In
        almost all cases the differences between the calculations are covered by
        the scale uncertainties, see Sec.~\ref{sec:scale_uncertainties}.}
    \label{fig:xs_nlo_comp}
\end{figure}


\subsection{NLO Correction Factors}
\label{sec:k_factors}

To check the influence of higher-order contributions to the perturbative QCD
prediction, the differences between LO prediction and NLO
prediction are studied, here expressed as the ratio $k_\mathrm{NLO}$.

\begin{equation*}
    k_{\mathrm{NLO}} = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{NLO}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{LO}}}
\end{equation*}

The size of NLO corrections gives an estimate about the influence of these
higher-order corrections. If they are small, the LO result already describes the
observable cross section precisely. It is also possible that the $k$-factors
fall below unity, in which case the NLO corrections are negative and the total cross
section decreases when adding the correction.  Fig.~\ref{fig:kfactor_comp} shows
the $k$-factors of the \NLOJETPP cross section calculations using the discussed
scale choices in Sec.~\ref{sec:scale_coice}. The $k$-factors are similar in the
central region, but the differences increase in regions with larger rapidity
separations. Especially the $k$-factors in the phase space region with a
rapidity separation of $2.0 \leq \ystar < 3.0$ are smaller than unity for the
\ptavg scale choice, while it is larger than one for the scale choices including
the \ystar dependence. Interestingly, also the scale uncertainties are much
larger in this region.

Apart from the findings for the \ptavg scale choice, the $k$-factors are
reliable and meet the expectations from previous studies of jet observables.

        \ystar values indicating that the NLO correction is negative in this
        phase space region.}

% integration and event generation steps are extremely time consuming, the phase
% space was split into twelve mutually exclusive regions binned in the transverse

\section{Non-Perturbative Corrections}
\label{sec:np_factors}
\todo{nlo np factors hw7}

Perturbative QCD calculations of \NLOJETPP give a cross section at NLO
parton level. These so-called fixed-order pQCD calculations cannot be directly
compared to unfolded data, as they do not include additional soft QCD
effects. While a part of these effects is absorbed by the jet algorithm,
they still must be estimated and accounted for in comparisons of fixed-order
calculations to data.

The influence of these soft effects are estimated using Monte Carlo event
generators which are able to simulate those. The usual approach consists of
calculating the cross section including effects from multi-parton interactions
(MPI) and hadronization. The non-perturbative (NP) correction $c_k^\mathrm{NP}$
obtained with a MC event generator $k$ is defined as the ratio between the
nominal cross section including MPI and hadronization effects and a cross section calculation
neglecting those, see Eq.~\ref{eq:np_definition}. The superscript in the
equation indicates the applied steps in the simulation: the parton shower (PS),
the multi-parton interaction model (MPI) and the hadronization (HAD). The
correction is then applied as a bin-by-bin correction factor to the NLO cross
section.

\begin{equation*}
    c_{k}^{\mathrm{NP}} = \frac{\sigma^{\mathrm{PS+HAD+MPI}}}{\sigma^{\mathrm{PS}}}
    \label{eq:np_definition}
\end{equation*}

The NP corrections have been calculated by employing two Monte Carlo event
generators using the newest available tunes within CMS. Herwig++ is used with
the tune UE-EE-5C~\cite{Seymour:2013qka} and Pythia 8 with the tune
CUETP8M1~\cite{Khachatryan:2015pea}. The ratio is fitted by a power-law function

\begin{equation*}
  f(\ptavg) = a \cdot \ptavg^b + c.
  \label{fcn:np_fit}
\end{equation*}

Since the correction factors obtained from Herwig++ and Pythia 8 are quite
different in the low-\pt region, an uncertainty is assigned to the correction
factor. The correction factors $c^\mathrm{NP}$ are determined by the average of the factors
obtained from the Pythia 8 and Herwig++ predictions,

\begin{equation*}
    c^\mathrm{NP} = \frac{c_{\mathrm{P8}}^{\mathrm{NP}} + c_{\mathrm{HW++}}^{\mathrm{NP}}}{2}
\end{equation*}
%
and the uncertainty quoted for the NP correction factors is given by half the difference
between the two correction factors.

Fig.~\ref{fig:np_factors} shows the resulting correction factors and the
corresponding uncertainty. The corrections vary between 8\% and 12\% at
\SI{133}{\GeV} and get smaller at higher values of \ptavg. While the correction
decreases for higher transverse momenta, it does not approach unity, especially
in the bins containing boosted jets.

    Herwig++. The average of both gives the central correction and the envelope

\end{figure}

\section{Theory Uncertainties}

Multiple sources of uncertainty limit the precision of the NLO cross section
calculation. In this section, the derivation of scale and PDF
uncertainties is described. The uncertainties
on non-perturbative correction uncertainties were already presented together
with the correction factors themselves in Sec.~\ref{sec:np_factors}. A
comparison of all studied theoretical uncertainties is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:theo_uncertainties}.

The scale uncertainty is the dominant source of uncertainty in the low-\pt
region and is of the size of 5\% to 10\% in most of the phase space regions. For
larger \ptavg, the PDF uncertainty becomes the dominant source. Its size ranges
from 5\% in the low-\ptavg region up to 50\% for highest \ptavg and \yboost
values. The uncertainty afflicted to non-perturbative corrections is only
sizable for lower \pt and is less than 5\% in all bins.

As the cross section calculation is performed using \fastNLO interfaced to
\NLOJETPP, multiple independent calculations can be merged to increase the
statistical precision of the calculation. The statistical uncertainty is
estimated by calculating the uncertainty on the arithmetic mean of the cross
section of all fastNLO tables. It is found to be smaller than 0.5\% in all bins,
in most of the bins even smaller than 0.1\%. Therefore, the statistical
uncertainty is neglected in all further comparisons.

\subsection{Scale uncertainties}
\label{sec:scale_uncertainties}

As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:scale_coice}, one has to choose a factorization
and renormalization scale for a perturbative cross section calculation and due to
the truncated perturbative series, a scale dependence remains. The effects of
neglected higher-order contributions are covered by a systematic theoretical
uncertainty.

There is a common approach in estimating the influence of the scale on the cross
section~\cite{Cacciari:2003fi}. The cross section calculation is performed using
multiple scale choices and the differences compared to the cross section
obtained using the central scale choice are translated into a scale uncertainty.
The variations are applied as multiplicative factors to the central choice in
the following six combinations: $(\mur, \muf) = (\sfrac{1}{2}, \sfrac{1}{2}),
(\sfrac{1}{2}, 1), (1, \sfrac{1}{2}), (1, 2), (2, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$ times the
nominal scale. The uncertainty on a quantity $X$, \eg the cross section, is the
envelope of the maximum deviation in the upwards and downwards direction, while
$X^0$ denotes the value of the quantity with the default scale choice and $n$
denotes the number of variations.

\begin{align*}
    \Delta X^+ &= \max_{i}^{n} \left[ X^i - X^0, 0 \right]\\
    \Delta X^- &= \max_{i}^{n} \left[ X^0 - X^i, 0 \right]
\end{align*}


Fig.~\ref{fig:scale_uncertainties} shows the relative size of the scale
uncertainty for each bin of the measurement and the discussed scale choices. The
scale uncertainty is of the size of 5\% to 10\%. However, when using the scale
choice $\mu=\ptavg$, the bin with the largest rapidity separation exhibits a large
increase of the uncertainty up to 40\%, which is clearly undesired.

        in six independent combinations. The uncertainty is shown for the three
        investigated scale choices, indicated by different colors. In most cases
        the scale uncertainty is reasonable and of the size of 5\% to 10\%. In
        the region with the largest values of \ystar, the scale uncertainty of
        the prediction with the scale choice $\mu=\ptavg$ is undesirably large.}
    \label{fig:scale_uncertainties}
\end{figure}

\subsection{PDF uncertainties}
\label{sec:pdf_uncertainties}

The dependence of the cross section calculation on the proton structure is
expressed in terms of parton distribution functions, which are derived from fits
to data from several experiments. Different sources of uncertainty affect the
PDFs. These comprise the choice and the functional form of the parametrization,
the chosen theory model and input parameters like the strong coupling constant
\as or the quark masses and, of course also the statistical and systematic
uncertainty sources of the data points included in the PDF fit.

When determining the PDFs, all these uncertainties are taken into account and
are propagated in the PDFs. The groups deriving the PDF sets provide
prescriptions how to evaluate these uncertainties. In
Sec.~\ref{sec:nlo_comparisons}, several comparisons of unfolded data to
predictions using the global PDF sets NNPDF 3.0, CT14 and MMHT2014 are shown. In
the following a short summary of the procedure to derive the PDF uncertainties
for these PDF sets is given.

The NNPDF PDF set~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} uses a large number of pseudo experiments,
in which the PDF fit is performed using data smeared within their uncertainties
while taking into account all correlations. These so-called replicas are
averaged to give the central result $X_\mathrm{central}$ and the spread of the
replicas determines the uncertainty. The symmetric PDF uncertainty $\Delta
X^\pm$ of a quantity $X$, which can be a cross section calculation or even the
PDF itself is expressed as

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta X^{\pm} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ X_{i} - X_{\mathrm{central}} \right]^2}
\end{equation*}
where $N$ denotes the number of replicas.

The CT14 ~\cite{Dulat:2015mca} and MMHT 2014~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} PDF
sets both employ the eigenvector method to encode their uncertainties. A
transformation from the parameter basis to the eigenvector basis is done to
yield mutually uncorrelated eigenvectors. By varying the eigenvectors upwards
and downwards, a set of eigenvector pairs is generated which can be used to
determine the asymmetric uncertainty $\Delta X^+$ and $\Delta X^-$ of a quantity
$X$. $X_0$ denotes the central prediction, $X_i^{\mathrm{up}}$ and
$X_i^{\mathrm{dn}}$ are the predictions using the upwards and downwards
variation of the eigenvector PDF set $i$ and $N_{\mathrm{EV}}$ is the number of
eigenvectors in the PDF set.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta X^+ &= \sqrt{\sum_i^{N_{\mathrm{EV}}} \left[ \max(X_i^{\mathrm{up}}
    -X_0, X_i^{\mathrm{dn}} - X_0, 0)\right]^2}\\
\Delta X^- &= \sqrt{\sum_i^{N_{\mathrm{EV}}} \left[ \min(X_i^{\mathrm{up}} - X_0, X_i^{\mathrm{dn}} - X_0,0)\right]^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The symmetric uncertainty $\Delta X^{\pm}$ is given by half the difference of the upwards and
downwards variation.

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta X^{\pm} = \sqrt{\sum_i^{N_{\mathrm{EV}}} \left[ \frac{X_i^+ -
    X_i^-}{2} \right]^2}
\end{equation*}

The uncertainty assigned to the CT14 PDF set describes a 90\% confidence
interval (CI), while the MMHT and NNPDF PDF uncertainties represent a 68\% CI.
The CT14 uncertainties are scaled to 68\% CI using $s = \sqrt{2}
\erf^{-1}(0.9) = 1.645$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdf_uncertainties} shows the fractional PDF uncertainty for the
three discussed global PDF sets. The PDF uncertainty in the bins with small
\ystar and small \yboost values is comparatively small. This is due to the fact
that mostly events with opposite side jets contribute, in which the medium-$x$
region of the proton PDFs is accessed which are well known already. The PDF
uncertainty of the cross section for high values of \ystar and low values of
\yboost in which two forward jets are on opposite sides of the detector is also
relatively small. Most interestingly the uncertainty strongly increases for the
bin with largest values of \yboost and small values of \ystar.  Especially in
the high-\pt region, the uncertainty is sizable. To achieve a high boost of the
dijet system and a high \ptavg value, the protons must be accessed in the
high-$x$ region which is not well determined up to now and is afflicted with
large PDF uncertainties. Especially the NNPDF PDF set has a large uncertainty in
this region. This is caused by its very flexible parametrization which results
in large PDF uncertainties in phase space regions not covered by data.

    \caption[Overview of theoretical uncertainties]{Overview of the theoretical uncertainties of the NLO prediction.
    The scale uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty in the low-\pt region. At
    high-\pt and especially in the forward region, the PDF uncertainty becomes
    dominant. The NP uncertainty is sizable only in the low-\pt region and becomes
    negligible at higher \pt when the NP corrections approach unity.}
