\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}

In this thesis, triple-differential dijet cross sections were measured forthe
first time using the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of \SI{8}{\TeV}.
The constraints on the PDFs of this measurements were studied and the strong
coupling constant \asmz determined.
