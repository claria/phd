\chapter{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}

The majority of the visible universe is built up by baryonic matter, held
together by the strong interaction. This interaction is responsible for the
binding of quarks and anti-quarks to hadrons at small scales. It also mediates
the binding force of protons and neutrons within the nucleus of an atom. The
strong interaction is described within the Standard Model by the theory of
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and has been very successful in predicting the
interaction between quarks at very high momentum transfers, which correspond to
very small distances. Several techniques have been developed which ease the
often very complicated QCD calculations. At high energies, the theory allows
perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations. This is currently the most precise
approach to QCD with a reasonable calculation time. Lattice QCD approaches the
strong interaction using a discrete set of space-time points to reduce the very
complicated path integrals to numerical computations which can be solved on
supercomputers. It has some advantages over pQCD as it is not limited to high
transverse momenta, but the problems of this very resource-intensive approach as
well as numerical problems lead to the preference of perturbative methods.

\section{Standard Model of Particle Physics}

In the mid of the 20th century, the Standard Model has been developed in a
collaborative approach by experimentalists and theorists. Experimental
discoveries and new theoretical models were combined into a comprehensive model
able to describe the observed phenomena. Since then, the Standard Model has been
probed in a large number of different experiments and it showed an impressive
agreement between the predictions and experimental results.

The Standard Model contains 12 fermions, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, from
which  the known matter in the universe is built up. Each of these fundamental
particles has its own anti-particle with opposite quantum numbers. These
particles are ordered in three so-called generations according to their
properties.

For each fermion, the charges, the third component of the weak isospin and the colour charge is shown. The corresponding anti-particles have opposite quantum numbers. The marker for the down-type quarks indicates the weak eigenstates of the quarks which can be transformed into mass eigenstates via the CKM\footnote{Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa}-matrix.}
\end{table}


The twelve fermions interact with each other through four fundamental forces,
the weak, the strong, the electromagnetic and the gravitational force, of which
the first three are described by the Standard Model. As gravity is too weak to
have an impact on physics on microscopic scales, this poses no problem for
high-energy physics. Step-by-step all of the predicted particles were observed
and the confidence in the Standard Model has increased with each confirmation.

\end{table}

However, the Standard Model is not an all-explaining theory, as there are many
free parameters which need to be determined by experiments.

\begin{itemize}
\item{the masses of the leptons and the quarks}
\item{the mass of the W/Z boson and of the Higgs boson}
\item{the coupling of the electromagnetic interaction, $\alpha$, and the strong coupling \as}
\item{the four parameters of the weak mixing matrix (CKM) of the quarks and leptons describing the transition of mass eigenstates to weak eigenstates.}
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, there are experimental discoveries, which cannot be explained
within the Standard Model like oscillation of the neutrino flavours. The
neutrinos are massless in the Standard Model, but the observed oscillation can
only be explained if neutrinos are massive. The transition probabilities are
summarised in the PMNS\footnote{Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata} matrix. Another
outstanding issue of the Standard Model was the predicted, but not yet found
Higgs boson and its mass. On July 4, 2012, CMS and ATLAS both announced the
discovery of a Higgs-like boson, which agrees with the expected properties of a
Higgs boson, at a mass of around \SI{125}{\giga
\electronvolt}~\cite{:2012gk,:2012gu}.

\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}

Quantum chromodynamics is the theory of the strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces. QCD  is a quantum field theory consisting of colour fields mediated by gluons. It describes the interactions between quarks and gluons and is responsible for the creation of hadrons and the binding of protons and neutrons into nuclei as well.
\todo{besser erkl√§ren}

The observation of bound quark states consisting of three up-quarks with parallel spin ($\Delta^{++}$) seemed to violate the Pauli Principle, which expects the particle wave function to be anti-symmetric. To restore the anti-symmetry of the wave function, an additional quantum number has been introduced. This quantum number is called colour-charge and the name of the charges are red, green and blue with their contrary anti-colour charges. The additional quantum number leads to a anti-symmetric wave function and explains the observations in consistency with the Pauli Principle.

\subsection{The QCD Lagrangian}

The theory of the interaction between quarks and gluons was initially formulated by Fritzsch, Gross, Wilczek and Weinberg as a quantum field theory, more specifically a non-abelian gauge theory~\cite{Weinberg:1973un, Fritzsch:1973pi, Gross:1973ju}. The dynamics of the quantum fields can be derived from the action using basic field theory. The action is defined in terms of the Lagrangian density as

\begin{equation}
S = i \int d^4 x \mathcal{L}(x)
\end{equation}

The equation of motion is found from the the minimisation of S using the Euler-Lagrange equation.

\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu \psi_i)} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \psi_i} = 0
\end{equation}

The Lagrangian for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ spinor field $\psi(x)$ results from quantum mechanics. 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \bar \psi (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu -m) \psi
\end{equation}

The Euler-Lagrange-equation applied to this Lagrangian gives the Dirac-equation.

\begin{equation}
(i\gamma^\mu \partial_mu -m) \psi(x) = 0
\end{equation}

The equation of motion for a Lagrangian containing normal derivatives is not invariant under transformations between possible gauges. Since this would break the gauge invariance, the minimal substitution method is applied which replaces the derivative $\partial_\mu$ with $D_\mu$ . This derivative introduces eight additional gauge fields $A_\mu^a$ to make the Lagrangian invariant under gauge transformations.

\begin{equation}
\partial_\mu \rightarrow D_\mu := \partial_\mu - ig A_\mu^a T^a
\end{equation} 

The additional term in the Lagrangian introduces the interaction between the gauge field $A_\mu^a$ and the field $\psi$. 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \bar \psi (i \gamma_{\mu} \partial \mu -m) \psi + g_s \bar \psi \gamma_\mu A_\mu^a T^a \psi
\end{equation}

To fully describe the gauge fields $A_\mu^a$, derivative terms have to be introduced which keep gauge and Lorentz invariance. In fact this can be done by the introduction of a gauge field strength tensor $F_{\mu \nu}^a$. 

\begin{equation}
F_{\mu\nu}^{a} = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a - g_s f^{abc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c
\end{equation}

This additional Lagrangian term is called the gauge part.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{gauge}} = - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu}^a F^{a \mu \nu}
\end{equation}


Free parameters of this theory are the gauge coupling $g_s$ and the quark masses. The strong coupling directly relates to the gauge coupling via $\as = g_s^2/4_\pi$. The fundamental couplings of the gluon are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fundamental:couplings}. Since QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, the self-coupling of the colour-carrying gluons leads to additional couplings compared to QED.

\end{figure}


\subsection{The Running Coupling of the Strong Interaction}

In analogy to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with the fine-structure constant $\alpha$, a coupling constant \as has been introduced for QCD. 
The strong coupling constant describes the strength of the interaction between the gluon and the colour charge $g_s = \sqrt{4\pi \as}$. Just as in QED, the coupling constant is not energy-independent, but changes with the squared momentum transfer \q. The energy dependence is due to particles originating from vacuum fluctuations, which interact with the electrical charge or colour-charge. These interactions should lead to an increase of the strong coupling constant at higher \q. But in QCD the gluons couple to themselves, leading to a dominating anti-screening effect. Therefore, effectively \as decreases at small distances (i.e. high momentum transfers). 

In processes with high momentum transfer, the coupling gets very small and the quarks can be regarded as free. This is also called \emph{asymptotic freedom}. However, if the momentum transfer is very small, the coupling can become very strong and perturbative techniques are not applicable anymore. Therefore all colour charges are bound together into colourless objects, and a separation of two coloured particles is not possible, but leads to the energetically more favourable creation of new colourless hadrons. This phenomenon is named \emph{confinement}.

\subsubsection{Energy Dependence of \as}

Physical observables can be written in a perturbative approach as an expansion in the strong coupling \as. Since it is possible that additional emissions and ultraviolet divergences arise, these have to be removed in a process called renormalisation. This introduces an additional energy scale $\mu$, and \as and physical observables get dependent on $\mu$. The fact that physical observables X do not depend on these scale is given mathematically by the renormalisation group equation (RGE):

\begin{equation}
\mu^2 \frac{d}{d \mu^2} X(\frac{q^2}{\mu^2},\as(\mu^2)) \stackrel{!}{=} 0 = \left( \mu^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial \mu^2} + \mu^2 \frac{\partial \as(\mu^2)}{\partial \mu^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial \as(\mu^2)} \right) X (\frac{q^2}{\mu^2},\as(\mu^2)
\end{equation}

The behaviour of the strong coupling constant can be explained by the introduction of a $\beta$-function


\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln \as(\mu^2)}{\partial \ln \mu^2} = \frac{\beta(\as(\mu^2))}{\as(\mu^2)}
\end{equation}

A perturbative ansatz for the solution of the $\beta$ function is 

\begin{equation}
\beta(\as(q^2)) = - \frac{\beta_0}{4\pi} \as^2(q^2) -\frac{\beta_1}{8 \pi^2} \as^3(q^2) + \mathcal{O}(\as^4)
\end{equation}

The coefficients $\beta_i$ can be calculated within a given renormalisation scheme like the $\overline{MS}$~\cite{PhysRevD.18.3998} scheme. With a one-loop QCD calculation, and a given number of quark flavours $n_f$, $\beta_0$ can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\beta_0 = \frac{33-2 n_f}{12\pi}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta_1 =\frac{153-19 n_f}{24 \pi^2}
\end{equation}

Solving the RGE equation for the one-loop solution of the $\beta$ function leads to

\begin{equation}
\as(q^2) = \frac{\as(\mu^2)}{1 + \as(\mu^2)\frac{\beta_0}{4 \pi} \ln(\frac{q^2}{\mu^2})}.
\end{equation}

To compare the strong coupling constant between different experiments, it is common usage to evaluate \as at $\mu^2= (M_Z)^2$. The results, which are available at next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) precision, are combined into a world average value of \as. The Particle Data Group reports \as currently as


\begin{equation}
\as(M_Z^2) = 0.1184 \pm 0.0007.
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Hadrons}

The confinement ensures the colour neutral state of observable objects. Since separating quarks from each other needs more energy than the creation of another quark-antiquark pair, the quarks combine into colourless bound states. These are called hadrons and can be classified according to their constituents.

\begin{description}
\item[Mesons] consist of one quark and one anti-quark. They have spin-0 or spin-1 and are therefore bosons.
\item[Baryons] consist of three quarks or anti-quarks. They have spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ and are fermions.
\end{description}

All hadrons except for the proton are unstable. The decay of a proton is studied, but has not yet been observed experimentally. The decay of such hadrons occur via the strong, weak or electro-magnetic interaction. 

The properties of the proton have been studied very carefully at particle colliders. The ideal way to probe the substructure of the proton is looking at deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of electrons or positrons through the exchange of a virtual photon. Above an energy of around \SI{1}{\giga \electronvolt}, the inner substructure of the proton is revealed and it was found that the proton consists of point-like particles, the so-called partons. The behaviour of the substructure of the proton can be described very well in the parton-model and even better in the QCD improved parton model.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

In DIS processes, the deviation from elastic scattering is described using the Bjorken scaling variable $x$. $P$ is the four-momentum of the proton with the mass $M$. The quantities $k$ and $k'$ are the four-momentum of the incoming and outgoing lepton. The exchanged particle transfers the four momentum $q$ = $k-k'$. The Lorentz invariant energy transfer is $\nu = \frac{Pq}{M_h}$. 

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{Q^2}{2 M_h \nu} = \frac{Q^2}{2 P q}
\end{equation}

In early publications at an energy of around \SI{3}{\giga \electronvolt}, it was shown, that the scaling behaviour $x$ is independent of $Q^2$. If the scattering occurs between spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, the measured structure functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ can be related through the Callan-Gross relation, which is only valid for fermionic objects.

\begin{equation}
2x F_1(x) = F_2 (x)
\end{equation} 

The DIS experiments confirmed that quarks are fermions. At higher momentum transfers, the parton masses can be neglected and the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ can be interpreted as the momentum fraction of the proton carried by one of the constituents. The momentum fraction carried by the parton i can be written as probability function $f_i(x_i)$. It was found that only half of the momentum of the proton is carried by the quarks. The question about the missing momentum has been solved by the QCD improved parton model which includes also the gluons as additional momentum-carrying partons.

\subsection{QCD Improved Parton Model}

In contrary to the naive assumptions of independent parton constituents in the quark parton model, the QCD improved parton model includes interactions between partons through the exchange of gluons. If the momentum transfer \q is large enough for \as to be treated in a perturbative approach calculations can be performed.

However the cross sections cannot be completely calculated in a perturbative approach. An important property of the theory is the ability to factorise the cross section into a hard scattering matrix element and the parton distribution functions. With short-range hard matrix element $\hat \sigma$, which is calculable in perturbative QCD, and the long-range parton distribution functions $f_a$ and $f_b$, the full cross section can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\sigma(x,Q^2) = \sum_f \int_{x_1,x_2}^1 dx_1 dx_2 f_a(x_1,\mu_F^2) f_b(x_2,\mu_F^2) \times \hat \sigma_{ab \rightarrow X} (\q, \mu_F, \mu_R) 
\end{equation}


However, through this separation, the PDFs is no longer scale independent, as gluons can be radiated. Dorkshitzer, Gribov, Lipatov, Altarelli and Parisi introduced the DGLAP evolution equations, which describe the impact on the PDFs due to changes in \q~\cite{Dokshitzer:1977sg,Gribov:1972ri,Altarelli:1977zs}. The PDFs themselves cannot be calculated in perturbative calculations, but have to be derived from experimental measurements.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

To compare the measurements at different scales, a PDF of a gluon or quark is defined at a low scale and then evolved to the experiment specific scale using the DGLAP evolution equations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q(x,\mu^2)}{\partial \log \mu^2} = \frac{\as}{2 \pi} \int_x^1 \frac{dz}{z} \left( P_{q \rightarrow q g}(z,\as)q \left(\frac{x}{z},\mu^2 \right) + P_{g  \rightarrow q q}(z,\as)g \left(\frac{x}{z},\mu^2 \right) \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial g(x,\mu^2)}{\partial \log \mu^2} = \frac{\as}{2 \pi} \int_x^1 \frac{dz}{z} \left( P_{q \rightarrow qg}(z,\as)q \left(\frac{x}{z},\mu^2 \right) + P_{q \rightarrow gg}(z,\as)g \left(\frac{x}{z},\mu^2 \right) \right)
\end{equation}

$z$ is the momentum fraction of the parton after radiation of the gluon, while the splitting functions $P_{a \rightarrow bc}(z,\as(\mu^2))$ describe the probability of radiation. The splitting function can be evolved in orders of \as as

\begin{equation}
P_{ab}(x;\as(\mu^2)) = P_{ab}^0(x) + \frac{\as}{2\pi}P_{ab}^1(x) + O(\as^2)
\end{equation}


The effect of the evolution can be seen from the comparison of a PDF at a low scale and a high scale. Figure \ref{fig:pdffit} shows the fitted PDF at a scale of $Q^2 = \SI{10}{GeV^2}$ and $Q^2 = \SI{200}{GeV^2}$. The gluon splitting leads to a strong rise of the gluon PDF and also to a small increase of the quark PDFs in the low-$x$ region when the PDF is evolved to higher scales.

\label{fig:pdffit}
\end{figure}

As each experiment can only cover a specific region of the phase space, it is important to combine data from different experiments to measure the PDF with the highest possible precision. Currently the global PDF studies combine data of the HERA and the Tevatron colliders as well as data from fixed-targets experiments. The covered range in $x$ and \q of each experiment is shown in Figure \ref{kinematic_plane}.

LHC data allows to probe the PDFs at high scales and covers the remaining $x$ region close to 1.0~\cite{Glazov:2007zz}.}
 	\label{kinematic_plane}
\end{figure}

Many different groups extract these PDF sets from published data using different approaches. The groups MSTW~\cite{Martin:2009iq}, CTEQ~\cite{Lai:2010vv}, NNPDF~\cite{Ball:2010de} and ABM~\cite{Alekhin:2012du} use data sets from all available experiments while the HERAPDF group~\cite{Aaron:2009aa} uses only data from the HERA collider. Due to the combination of datasets from many different sources, this poses also an important cross check of the compatibility between these data sets. More details on each PDF can be found in the cited publication by the respective PDF group.

\section{Cross Sections}

In order to verify the predictions made by pQCD, one needs an observable to compare the measurement to the calculation. The cross section $\sigma$ is such an observable. It is defined as the interaction rate per target particle $W$ normalised to the particle flux $\Phi$:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{W}{\Phi}
\end{equation}

The comparison between the theoretically derived and the measured cross section gives some indications of the goodness of the used model, or also might contain hints on new physics. The commonly used unit of the cross section is a \emph{barn}, with $\SI{1}{\barn} = \SI{e-28}{\metre \squared}$. It is often useful to define the cross section differentially, e.g. in terms of transverse momentum \pt and the rapidity $y$ as it has been done for the inclusive jet cross section.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

The interaction rate W can be calculated with Fermi's Golden Rule, which uses the quantum-mechanical transition matrix elements $|M_{fi}|$ between initial and final state and the energy density $\rho_f$ of the final states.


\begin{equation}
W = \frac{2}{\pi} \mid M_{fi}^2 \mid \rho_f
\end{equation}

The properties of the collider are related to the number of produced events. 

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{W}{L}
\end{equation}

Therefore, the instantaneous luminosity L is defined, which contains for the LHC quantities like the numbers of protons per bunch, the properties of the beam optics and the energy. 
The actually used luminosity is measured experimentally by relating the nuclear elastic forward scattering amplitude with the total cross section. The absolute luminosity scale is determined using Van der Meer scans. This procedure scans the LHC beams through one another to measure the size of the beams at the collision point.
