\section{Jet ID Efficiency}

The jet ID selection ensures a high purity of real jet events while keeping more than 99\% of the real jets.
The efficiency of the jet id is studied using a tag-and-probe approach. Well balanced jets in $\phi$ are selected
using a criteria of $\Delta \phi > 2.7$. While one jet needs to pass the tight jet id criteria, the balanced jet is probed
if if satisfies the criteria as well. The ratio of events where the probe jet passes the criteria versus the number of events
in which the probe doesn't pass the critera is used to estimate the efficiency. The efficiency is plotted as a function of the
dijet \ptavg as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:jetid_eff}. The efficiency is in all bins larger than 99\%.
