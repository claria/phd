    The first measurement of triple-differential dijet cross sections at the LHC
    is presented using \SI{19.71}{\fbinv} of data collected with the CMS
    detector in proton-proton collisions at \SI{8}{\TeV}. The cross sections are
    measured as a function of the average transverse momentum, the rapidity
    separation, and the boost of the two leading jets. The unfolded cross
    sections agree with perturbative QCD calculations at NLO accuracy apart from
    phase space regions containing strongly boosted dijets events, in which the
    measurement is sensitive to the PDFs.  Constraints on the PDFs are derived
    by including the data in a PDF fit together with DIS cross sections from the
    HERA experiments. Compared to a fit with HERA DIS data alone, the
    uncertainties of the PDFs, especially those of the gluon PDF, are
    significantly reduced and a harder gluon PDF is obtained.
