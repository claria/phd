    The first measurement of triple-differential dijet cross sections at the LHC is presented
    using \SI{19.71}{\fbinv} of data collected with the CMS detector in
    proton-proton collisions at \SI{8}{\TeV}. The cross section is measured as a
    function of the average transverse momentum of the two leading jets and
    binned in the rapidity separation and the boost of the dijet system. The
    measured cross sections agree with perturbative QCD calculations at NLO
    accuracy apart from phase space regions containing strongly boosted dijets
    events, in which the measurement is sensitive to the PDFs. Constraints
    on the PDFs are demonstrated by including the data in a PDF fit resulting in
    significantly reduced uncertainties of the PDFs, especially of the gluon PDF.
